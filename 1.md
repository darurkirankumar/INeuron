## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

	Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems.
	It is not written in machine readable language. Python program needs to be processed before a machines can run them as it is an Interpreted language. It means every time a program runs, the interpreter has to translate the python code to machine readable byte-code.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

	Dynamic typing means that the type of the variable is determined at run time. Even if we don't specify the type of the variable, python determines the type at the run time bases on the value of variable at that time.
	Because of dynamic typing, the same variable can have different types at diffrent times during execution.
	Dynamic typing typing aloows flexibility in programming but at cost of performance.
